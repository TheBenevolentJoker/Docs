# ðŸ”° Expansion

At the beginning of every epoch, if the time weighted average price (TWAP) of MvDOLLAR is greater than 1.01, new MvDOLLAR will be minted in the boardroom.

The amount of new MvDOLLAR distributed depends on the current circulating supply of MvDOLLAR.&#x20;

The first 28 epochs (7 days) after the boardroom launches will have 2.5% emissions to account for continued MvDOLLAR rewards during this time.
