# MiniVerse Finance Docs

[MiniVerse Finance](https://app.mvfinance.club/) is an algorithmic stable coin protocol pegged 1:1 to USDC on Fantom. Inspired by previous algorithmic stable protocols such as Basis Cash and Tomb Finance. Much like Tomb our protocol uses three tokens (MvDOLLAR, MSHARE, MvBOND) to incentivize a stable 1:1 peg to USDC.&#x20;

The protocol's underlying mechanism dynamically adjusts MvDOLLAR's supply, pushing its price up or down relative to the price USDC. This should be $1 however there may be times where USDC loses its peg and if our protocol is functioning as intended will follow USDC to keep pegged 1:1 to it.
