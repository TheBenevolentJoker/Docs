The MiniVerse Finance Breeding Game is novel adaptation on **node protocols**. It is also heavily inspired by NFT GameFi projects like **Defi Kingdoms** but with our "MiniTwist". The breeding game will allow the protocol to **collect a substantial amount of MvDOLLAR** that can be used for strategic **burns and redistributing**. It also allows MiniVerse Genesis NFT holders long term MvDOLLAR emissions without hurting the health of protocol.&#x20;

**The breeding game is meant to be a long-term game and is being designed to be played for many months or possibly years. There is always the possibility to expand and adapt the breeding game as well.**

### MiniFrens Generations Breeding Breakdown <a href="#f55e" id="f55e"></a>

The MiniFrens Generations Collection will be the breed-able collection in the GameFi ecosystem. MiniFrens Generations will have a soft capped supply at **8076** and **4 different generations.** This will bring the total supply of MiniVerse NFTs to 10,000 + Land (555 supply). We will also be adding new Mini animals to each generation. The possibilities are endless think about MiniTigers or MiniLions and much more!

### How to Breed:

* **Hold 2 MiniVerse NFTs** (Guineas,Chillas,Frens)&#x20;
* Choose one of your NFTs (MiniFren base level 12 or higher) to be **blacklisted** from breeding again (Needs [MiniCoffee](minimarket.md) to unblacklist to breed again)
* Breeds **base level 0** MiniFren Generations
* Current Breed Limits: You can breed **9 MiniFrens** per one MiniGuinea or MiniChilla and **6 MiniFrens** from one MiniFren
